/**
 * Problem Statement: Suppose we want to Produce N number of pens, Initially we have one pen, so far,
 * the next consecutive days we can either  double the product of the previous day or increase the production by one
 * We want to find the minimum number of the days to produce exactly N number of pens.
 * Note: Time complexity of the solution is less than O(N)
 *
 * Example:
 * N:7
 * Answer: 4
 *
 *
 * Initially: 1
 * First-day: 2(add one)
 * Second-day: 3(add-one)
 * third-day: 6(double the previous day production)
 * fourth-day: 7
